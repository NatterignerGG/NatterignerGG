 Hi there!

👋 Hi, I’m @NatterignerGG!

👀 I’m interested in Art, Animals, Code, and also art restoration, as it is another of my studies!

🌱 I’m currently learning to code and I’m working hard to keep learning!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in programming to learn little by little. Additionally, if the theme is related to art, I could contribute a lot to it!

😄 Pronouns: she/her.

⚡ Fun fact: I love animals, especially dogs like dachshunds because i own their since i was a little girl and they are so silly! and I decided to study programming because it’s a vast world to know, and unfortunately, 
the life of art restoration isn’t an easy or secure field. However, it’s a path I’m really enjoying!
